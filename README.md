"# Neural-networks-from-scratch" </br>
Recently I have started Reading the book Neural Networks from Scratch in Python by Kinsley and Kukiela and by shraring the notebooks of each Chapter Im thrilled to tell its story via this repository </br>
chapter 1 : introduction </br>
chapter 2 : coding first neurons </br>
chapter 3 : adding layers </br>
chapter 4 : activation functions </br>
chapter 5 : loss </br>
